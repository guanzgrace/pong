      <div id="events"><h1><br/>About the League</h1><h4>The Princeton University Ping Pong League is a semester-based ping pong league tournament geared towards Princeton University graduates and undergraduates who are interested in playing casual ping pong matches and competing for nothing else other than the fun and the potential of meeting fellow students through weekly matches. Two tournaments are organized every year (one in the fall and one in the spring), the frequency of the matches is two per week, no fee is required for participation and, starting this semester, students from any residential college can sign up for competing in the League.<br/><br/>Rules: There are 10 preliminary rounds and each match in the preliminary round is a best of 3, with each set being the first to 21. Serves alternate every 5 points. A win counts for 1 point and a loss counts for 0 points. The tie breaker criteria are first the net sets won by the players and then the total sets won by the players. The playoffs format will be announced on Preliminary Round 8.<br/><br/>Format: Frequency of games: 2 matches / week. The leaderboard, matchups and results of each round will be announced by email by the league administrator. It is the players' responsibility to contact each other to arrange a time and place for their match and report the results to the administrator Yannis Karakozis via email at ick@princeton.edu. If a player cannot play, it is considered a forfeit (2-0) in favor of their opponent. Recommendation: Both players should report the result of the match to the administrator to ensure that the correct outcome of the match is registered. In the case that a match is not played or the players do not inform the administrator by email, the result will be registered as (0-0) and each player will be penalized with a penalty point. A player with 3 penalty points will be kicked out of the league. (Note: No penalty points will be accrued in the case of a forfeit). Ping pong tables you can play at: Wilcox Commons, Frist 2nd floor by the Pool Tables, Dillon Gym Reception Desk, Mathey Common Room.<br/><br/>History: In fall of 2015, Yannis Karakozis, a Wilson College freshman, founded the Wilson College Ping Pong League. Since then, he has been the sole League administrator and has been running the tournament without any logistical or financial support from any University or College agency. In the first Season, 40 Wilson College students signed up, with 28 of them sticking till the end of the tournament. In spring of 2016, during the second season of the League's organization, the league included Butler College. 60 students signed-ups 46 of whom played until the very last round. In Season 3, with the inclusion of Whitman College, those numbers increased to 86 and 58 respectively. Throughout this period, the League had also been open to graduate students.</h4></div>
